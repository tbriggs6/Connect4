# Connect4
An adversarial mini-max Connect Four (actually Connect-N) game player. 

This plays a Connect-N game using mini-max search with alpha-beta pruning.  When I taught the AI course, I would set-up a double-elimination bracket, and give extra credit for each round the students survived.  My agent was the "boss level" and if they beat my player, they got the most extra credit.  I didn't go all out because I wanted to give them at least a little chance.
